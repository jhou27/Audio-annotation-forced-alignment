This repo provides an analytic pipeline to process audio recordings and their corresponding annotation files. 
Orthographic transcriptions of audio data are submitted to a sequence of Praat and R codes, as well as the auto-segmentation program SPPAS (Bigi, 2018), 
to produce sets of word- and syllable-based phonetic transcriptions of Hong Kong Cantonese language productions. 
Specifically, this repo contains steps on how to format annotation files for auto- segmentation, how to carry out phonetic forced alignment, 
and how to extract data files that can be further annotated for use in the CLAN program within the CHILDES child language database.
